# Autism-Prediction-System-Using-ML
This project uses machine learning to detect Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) early by analyzing behavioral and demographic data, such as age, gender, family history, and AQ-1 to AQ-10 responses. Various algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBClassifier and Decision Tree, were tested, with the best model showing high accuracy and reliability.
